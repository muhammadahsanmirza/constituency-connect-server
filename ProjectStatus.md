Based on the complaint controller implementation and the use case diagram, here's an analysis of what we've implemented and what's still pending:

### Successfully Implemented Use Cases:

1. **Report Complaint** - Constituents can submit complaints with the `submitComplaint` function
2. **View Complaints** - Both representatives and constituents can view complaints
3. **Update Complaint Status** - Representatives can update complaint status with the `updateComplaint` function
4. **Track Complaint Status** - Constituents can track their complaints with `getConstituentComplaints`
5. **Delete Complaint** - Constituents can delete their own complaints

### Use Cases Not Yet Implemented:

1. **Forward Complaint** - The ability to forward complaints to other departments/representatives
2. **Highlight Urgent Complaint** - Prioritization system for urgent complaints
3. **Receive Notification** - Notification system for status updates
4. **Track Complaint History** - Tracking the history of status changes
5. **View Representative Stats** - Statistics about representative performance
6. **Participate in Surveys** - Survey creation and participation
7. **Record Survey Result** - Storing and analyzing survey responses
8. **View Awareness Campaign** - Awareness campaign information display
9. **Run Awareness Campaign** - Creating and managing awareness campaigns
10. **Provide Feedback** - General feedback mechanism (separate from complaints)
11. **Attend/Arrange Virtual Meetups** - Virtual meeting scheduling and attendance
12. **View/Post Event Calendar** - Event management system
13. **Create Surveys** - Survey creation for representatives
14. **Compute Survey Result** - Analysis of survey data
15. **View Survey Result** - Displaying survey results to users
16. **Compute Stats** - Statistical analysis of complaint data

To continue implementing the system according to the use case diagram, we should prioritize core features like notifications and complaint history tracking, then move on to the more advanced features like surveys, events, and virtual meetups.

Would you like me to start implementing any of these missing use cases next?
